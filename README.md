Robot-Readable-Repton
=====================

Exploring what happens if you try and design a game to be played by another machine using computer vision.

Very early stages atm, so far code that reads in a map from an array of data, renders it onto a canvas.

Next steps will be to have a smaller "game window" that shows just a smaller area of the map. Then scrolling :)
